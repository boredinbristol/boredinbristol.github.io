		<h2> BEERD </h2>
		<p> Average cost: ££ Location: St Michael's Hill </p>
		<p> What could be better than good pizza and a fine selection of beer? You're right, I can't think of anything better either. Inspired to create authentic, tasty Italian pizzas and replicate America's craft beer bars, Beerd effortlessly achieves the perfect Italian-American mix. As with any great pizza place, you'll have to fork out a little extra, but don't let that put you off. Your tastebuds will thank you for it later, that I can promise you. However, Beerd do over a lunch-time special - you can eat a delicious pizza for less than a fiver! If you come to love Beerd as much as us, sign up for a Beerd student card at the bar next time you visit and you can get 10% off food and drink! Who doesn't love a discount? </p>

		<h2> Wildwood </h2>
		<p> Average cost: £-££  Location: Clifton Village </p>
		<p> Located a mere 10 minute walk from Clifton Suspension Bridge, the two can easily be combined to satisfy both your hunger and sightseeing needs. Wildwood isn't one to miss, especially if you're a student - simply bring along your student card and download the code from their <a href="http://www.wildwoodrestaurants.co.uk/offers/student-discount" target="_blank"> website</a> and you can get a whopping 50% off! As if a fantastic discount isn't enough to entice you, the food is phenomenal. From pasta dishes, to burgers, to pizzas, there's something for everyone at Wildwood, all cooked to perfection. Top tip - try the philly cheesesteak burger. You will not be disappointed.   </p>

		<h2> Taka Taka </h2>
		<p> Average cost: ££  Location: Clifton Triangle </p>
		<p> One of the great things about Taka Taka, asides from the fact it's Greek food, is that there's literally nothing better after a night out than gyros from Taka Taka. Quite possibly cooked by the Greek Gods themseleves, the food tastes like a slice of heaven. Don't let the queues put you off, its more than worth the wait - it really is that good. You can watch your food be prepared freshly made right in front of you, or have it delivered directly to your front door from 19:45 through <a href="https://www.just-eat.co.uk/restaurants-magicrolltakataka-bs8/menu" target="blank">justeat.co.uk</a>. If you're a big fan of Greek food, or just looking for some tasty post-night out snacks, Taka Taka is the place for you. </p>

		<h2> Parson's bakery </h2>
		<p> Average cost: £  Location: St Michael's Hill/Clifton Village </p>
		<p> If you're anything like me, you'll be more than disappointed at the lack of Greggs around campus and Clifton in general. But that'll soon fade when you try out Parson's bakery to satsify all of your pastry needs. Fancy a bacon sandwich and coffee to go in the mornings before your 9am lecture? Or maybe a sausage roll and a cupcake for lunch? And all at a great price? Parson's is the place to go. Conveniently located behind campus, you can eat and make it on time to your lectures. With such a great selection of pastries, bread, cakes, and sandwiches, you'll soon have forgotten all about Greggs.  </p>
