		<h2> Mockingbird Cafe </h2>
		<p> Average cost: £  Location: CLifton </p>
		<p> Just behind Whiteladies lies the instagrammable haven that is Mockingbird. Relatively small, it is usually filled with the steady buzz of brunching friends combined with the clacking keyboard keys of laptops. The coffee is good (try their sweet signature Mississippi Mud) but the American South themed food is even better. Try not to be too shocked that biscuits and gravy is a menu choice. Top tip - ask them to make an orange mocha. You won't regret it. </p>

		<h2> Cori Tap </h2>
		<p>  Average cost: £  Location: Clifton Village </p>
		<p> The Cori Tap (full name: Coronation Tap) is one of the oldest Bristol student traditions, with students converging on this cosy village venue for decades. Be warned: this is no ordinary pub. The Cori Tap is famous for its lethal exhibition cider, which is strictly served only in half pints due to its high alcohol content. Many students attempt the arguably unwise 'Ten Before 10' Cori Tap Challenge, which involves consuming ten half pints of exhibition cider before the clock hits 10pm. Each half pint will set you back £2.50, and the Cori Tap Challenge a hefty £25. If your body and bank account mean business, this is the place to go. </p>

		<h2> The Brass Pig </h2>
		<p> Average cost: ££  Location: Clifton Triangle </p>
		<p> For student drinkers who want something a little more special than a Spoons night, the Brass Pig is a fantastic choice. Its menu offers a range of tasty and interesting cocktails alongside your usual bar array. BoredinBristol recommends that students aim for Wednesday nights for 2-4-1 deals and look out for the Sunday roast in particular! Those involved in societies and socials will love the spacious downstairs bar and sofa areas for planning big student events. It's a must for both wild bar crawls and quiet drinks with friends. Top tip: be careful of the Zombie cocktail! There's a reason the menu specifies that you are only permitted to order two per person in one night... </p>

		<h2> Playground Coffee House </h2>
		<p> Average cost: £  Location: Central Bristol </p>
		<p> Fancy swinging around and playing board games whilst you enjoy a steaming hot mug of coffee? Then Playground Coffee House is the place for you. With friendly staff, great coffee and a brilliant selection of board games, you'll leave more than happy you stumbled upon this little gem. And even better, rake in the Instagram likes with a pic taken sat on one of the swings - I guarantee it'll be the coolest photo on anybody's feed that day. So what are you waiting for? Go now!  </p>
