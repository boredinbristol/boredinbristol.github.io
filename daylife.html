		<h2> Clifton Suspension Bridge </h2>
		<p> Average cost:FREE  Location: Clifton Village  </p>
		<p> Want to take an instagram worthy photo whilst simultaneously demonstrating how pretty Bristol is to your friends and family back home? Clifton Suspension Bridge is without a doubt the place to go. Surrounded by stunning scenery, with Leigh Woods a short walk across the bridge, the views will not let you down. Brave your fears and take a walk over the bridge. Alternatively, if its just too high, view the bridge in all its glory from the hill beside it. Fancy a break from revision in summer? Take a picnic with you to the hill and you can eat and relax surrounded by a breathtaking view - it really is a sight you must see at least once when in Bristol. </p>

		<h2> Cabot Tower </h2>
		<p> Average cost:FREE  Location: Brandon Hill, Clifton </p>
		<p> Without a doubt the best place to view the whole of Bristol from. Located on Brandon Hill, opposite Wills Memorial Building, you can get a stunning birdseye view of everything the city has to offer. However this will come at a price - there's no way around it, you will have to walk up a lot of steep, narrow steps. But the view, along with the fact it's FREE, means you'll be glad you did so when you reach the top. Best to go on a sunny day, relax or take a walk around Brandon Hill once you've climbed the tower - a great place for BBQs in the summer. </p>

		<h2> Stokes Croft </h2>
		<p> Average cost: FREE/£  Location: Stokes Croft </p>
		<p> Bristol's equivalent to Shoreditch in London, Stoke's Croft is as edgy as it gets. Populated with charity shops and grafitti, its the perfect place to go to find your wavy garms ready for that big night out in Motion or Lakota. Every Bristol student should visit Stoke's Croft at least once, its charm is unbeatable. Whether you're shopping or just having a look around, Stoke's Croft is a must. </p>

		<h2> Leigh Woods </h2>
		<p> Average cost: FREE/£  Location: Abbot's Leigh </p>
		<p> Looking to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city? Leigh Woods provides the perfect escape. A picturesque wood on the other side of the bridge, you really will feel like you're in the countryside, surrounded by nature. Also great for racking up the likes on instagram! Make sure to wear old trainers or wellies as it can be very muddy sometimes, but it's perfect for a breath of fresh air. </p>
